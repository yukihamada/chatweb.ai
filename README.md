# Chatweb.ai

Chatweb.ai is a web application for a chat UI that utilizes large language models such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 to provide dynamic prompt generation and action addition functionalities. It also comes with a webhook feature that supports multiple messenger apps, making it accessible on a wide range of platforms.

## Key Features

- Utilizes powerful language models such as GPT series and PaLM to improve natural language processing.
- Provides flexibility for users to add their own prompts and actions.
- Comes with a chat UI web application and webhook functionalities that support multiple messenger apps.
- Designed to record and retain user state, as well as understand past conversations.
- Generates human-readable content and enables more intuitive interactions, including Japanese.

## Concerns

- Limitations of language models: While language models such as GPT-3 and GPT-4, as well as Google's PaLM, are powerful, they do not always provide accurate answers or appropriate actions. Additionally, while there is a feature to generate responses based on past conversations, the contextual understanding is not always perfect, leading to occasional inappropriate responses.
- Performance and cost: Utilizing large language models requires high computational resources, which can decrease performance and increase costs.
