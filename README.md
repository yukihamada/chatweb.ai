# voiceGPTweb

voiceGPTweb is a user-friendly web application that enables voice-based conversations with language models such as GPT-3 and GPT-4. The project's goal is to achieve more natural language processing, increase knowledge, and create a new ecosystem where open extensions such as plugins can be added.

The application features a chat UI web app and webhook functionality that are compatible with multiple messaging platforms. voiceGPTweb generates clear and easy-to-understand content, including Japanese, to provide a seamless voice conversation experience. It is a lightweight open-source application that is ideal for beginners and has high customization capabilities. The ultimate goal is to assist users in performing various tasks with just voice commands.

## Concerns

- Limitations of language models: While language models such as GPT-3 and GPT-4, as well as Google's PaLM, are powerful, they do not always provide accurate answers or appropriate actions. Additionally, while there is a feature to generate responses based on past conversations, the contextual understanding is not always perfect, leading to occasional inappropriate responses.
- Performance and cost: Utilizing large language models requires high computational resources, which can decrease performance and increase costs.
